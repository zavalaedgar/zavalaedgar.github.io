                <p>Today's card of the day is Hawlucha EX from the Furious Fists set. This card made it on the list because of its artwork. Aside from the awesome artwork, this card has some of the most concrete Abilities and Move. Everytime san opponent's pokemon attacks you, they also do damage to themselves. </p>
