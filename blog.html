    <p>
        I have been collecting Pokemon Cards ever since I was a young kid. I first heard about Pokemon when my neighbor and his uncle would always show off their cards to me. Eventually when they got older they handed me their cards because they did not need them. Over the years I would buy all the theme packs and booster packs. I have a massive collection of both rare cards and common cards. I would say i carry more than 2000 cards in my collection.
